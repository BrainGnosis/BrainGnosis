Dawood — thank you for the thoughtful (and very fair) feedback. I agree the current framing can feel abstract, and we need to be much sharper on the “problem solved” and the vertical story.

At a high level, your understanding is directionally correct: LinkWare is a platform to orchestrate real-world scientific work by connecting LLM-driven intent (“what to do next”) with the physical layer (“what actually happened”) -- across instruments, sensors, and humans in the loop.

More specifically, LinkWare is solving the problem of agentic reliability, integration, and adaptability for the pharmaceutical industry by linking data, hardware, and software for intelligent automation. We have built a neurosymbolic agentic platform to link the digital (software) and physical (hardware) worlds for intelligent automation in pharma and healthcare.

Our flagship product, AgentOS, a vertical-agnostic neurosymbolic platform, combines neural intelligence with symbolic reasoning to create structured, reliable agents. We have already developed and deployed custom, production-reliable agents that connect data, software, and hardware to drive scientific and drug development automation, analysis, and workflow orchestration for customers including pharma teams and NIH.

A few clarifications on what we believe is distinct and defensible:

What we’re solving (in a vertical way)
In pharma R&D, the bottleneck is not generating text or code—it’s reliably executing, observing, and iterating experiments across heterogeneous lab environments. LinkWare’s aim is to make researchers dramatically more productive by turning experimental workflows into repeatable, auditable “closed-loop” runs that span instruments, data streams, and decision logic.
Not tied to one hardware stack
We’re not building for one specific piece of equipment or a single vendor configuration. LinkWare is designed to work across arbitrary instrument setups and evolving lab footprints, so teams don’t have to rebuild their infrastructure every time they add/remove/change equipment.
Why LLMs alone are insufficient
LLMs can generate software and propose plans, but they do not reliably plan and execute in the physical world without structure, constraints, and grounded state. In scientific automation, “good enough” is not good enough—systems must be deterministic where needed, verifiable, and safe, with robust error-handling and provenance. Without deep integration into the physical layer, “AI automating discovery” becomes more aspiration than operational reality.
Why OpenAI/Anthropic won’t simply “do the same”
Foundation model companies can provide strong general reasoning layers, but the hard problem (and our focus) is the systems layer: instrument abstraction, bidirectional control, sensor/telemetry ingestion, orchestration, validation, compliance-grade traceability, and deployment into real customer environments. That integration surface area—and the operational data + workflows it produces—becomes the moat over time.
On companies like RadicalAI
Yes—adjacent efforts are clearly interesting, and we track them closely. The key distinction is that LinkWare is not “one robot/lab driving one setup,” but an extensible platform that can be deployed across many different instrument configurations and organizational constraints, particularly in pharma.
Completely agree on the point about positioning: we are intentionally doubling down on the pharma sector right now, and we will revise both the deck and website accordingly. The current slides and site are not yet “prime time,” and we’ll tighten the narrative around measurable productivity and operational outcomes.

More soon—happy to talk more for clarification.

Best,
Gaurav
